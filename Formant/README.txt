TO DO:
write routes 
create models
link db/server (forgot how to link mongoDB)
seed database
connect to frontend and test seeded data


Architecture:
A user should be able to add their paint collection to their account
Recipes tab for saving a paint recipe which is also saved to account (select paints from their collection or from all paints) **should
    also show if the paints in the recipe are in their current collection or not**
Miniatures tab should have a list of GW miniatures with their pictures
    The user can attach recipes to parts of the Miniatures
    **To start, this can simply be a list of recipes with labels indicating placement on the Miniatures
